After years of keeping it private I decided to make my Hackerrank solutions repo public.

I originally kept it private because of the competitive nature of Hackerrank but it turns out tens of thousands of people publish their solutions in repos, blogs or forums anyway and so I might as well open my solutions for someone to get inspired... or scared... or offended :)
